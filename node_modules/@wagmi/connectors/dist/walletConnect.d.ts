     * If a new chain is added to a previously existing configured connector `chains`, this flag
     * will determine if that chain should be considered as stale. A stale chain is a chain that
     * WalletConnect has yet to establish a relationship with (ie. the user has not approved or
     * rejected the chain).
     *
     * Preface: Whereas WalletConnect v1 supported dynamic chain switching, WalletConnect v2 requires
     * the user to pre-approve a set of chains up-front. This comes with consequent UX nuances (see below) when
     * a user tries to switch to a chain that they have not approved.
     *
     * This flag mainly affects the behavior when a wallet does not support dynamic chain authorization
     * with WalletConnect v2.
     *
     * If `true` (default), the new chain will be treated as a stale chain. If the user
     * has yet to establish a relationship (approved/rejected) with this chain in their WalletConnect
     * session, the connector will disconnect upon the dapp auto-connecting, and the user will have to
     * reconnect to the dapp (revalidate the chain) in order to approve the newly added chain.
     * This is the default behavior to avoid an unexpected error upon switching chains which may
     * be a confusing user experience (ie. the user will not know they have to reconnect
     * unless the dapp handles these types of errors).
     *
     * If `false`, the new chain will be treated as a validated chain. This means that if the user
     * has yet to establish a relationship with the chain in their WalletConnect session, wagmi will successfully
     * auto-connect the user. This comes with the trade-off that the connector will throw an error
     * when attempting to switch to the unapproved chain. This may be useful in cases where a dapp constantly
     * modifies their configured chains, and they do not want to disconnect the user upon
     * auto-connecting. If the user decides to switch to the unapproved chain, it is important that the
     * dapp handles this error and prompts the user to reconnect to the dapp in order to approve
     * the newly added chain.
