<!-- Introducing E-Collector : The Future of E-commerce -->
## About The Project

### What is E-Collector?

E-Collector is a game-changer for both buyers and sellers!

It's a token that uses blockchain to let you buy goods now and get them as you like, anytime, anywhere!

It's not a coupon or a gift card. It's a digital asset that you can trade, transfer or gift as you wish!

It saves you time and money, improves the circulation of goods, and helps sellers earn more and keep customers happy!
